title: Deterministic radiation transport
---

Deterministic codes numerically solve the Boltzmann transport equation using approximates such as the continuous slowing down (CSDA) and straight-ahead approximations.  With proper tuning, they can rival the accuracy of Monte Carlo codes at a significantly reduced computational burden.
