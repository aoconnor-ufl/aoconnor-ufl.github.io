# So you want to run a transport code for space radiation?
n.b. this primer focuses on radiation in aerospace environments, so certain codes or topics (_e.g._ criticality) common to radionuclear simulations may be abridged or neglected

## What jargon should you know?
Automated computation of radiation transport evolved in the 1940s and 50s, so some of the terminology reflects that period rather than modern usage.

| Jargon | Synonym | Explanation |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| card | input data/file | defines the setup of the transport problem (*e.g.* materials card, geometry card, (radiation) source card)
| code | program | the computer program that transports the radiation |
| filter | region | the region of interest |
| (input) deck | | the overall collection of input data and files that define the transport problem |
| score | statistic | the event, function, or statistic of interest |
| tally | output data/file | final output data based on filter and score from a (set of) particle(s) |
| transport | movement | the process of moving the radiation particles (or quanta) through a specified medium |

A **tally** may be the dose in water from neutrons behind a shield material.
A **filter** would be the volume of that water region.
A **score** would be the energy deposited (dose).

### Jargon example
> The *absorbed dose* in the **water tank** is ***10.7 Gy***.
+ ***Tally***: dose in water from neutrons behind a shield material
+ **Filter**: volume of that water region
+ *Score*: energy deposited (dose)

Only the indicated portion of the gammaâ€™s path through the water tank contributes to the tally.

However, the code must track all other particles in case a delta ray (secondary radiation) crosses through water tank
