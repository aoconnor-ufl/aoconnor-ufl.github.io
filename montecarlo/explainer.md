### Writing a Monte Carlo Radiation Transport Code
Don't waste your time reinventing the wheel like this, but it may be helpful to understand the innner workings of such codes.

### UIUC MSTE
Contains an interactive, online applet demonstrating Buffon's Needle thought-experiment.
Demonstrates 1) regression to the mean: as the number of trials increases, the observed value will approach the expected value and 2) inferential statistics: provided a sufficient sample of a population, the population statistics may be inferred from the sample.
