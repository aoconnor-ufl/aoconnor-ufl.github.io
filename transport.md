` From the same starting point, move eight paces choosing a random orthogonal direction for each step (can double back) `
+ Results are stochastic distribution of distances from starting point
+ Radiation (as particles) progresses through material similarly
  - No interaction: same direction
  - Scattering: change in direction
  - Absorption: end movement
  
	n.b. three examples for simplicity; many more processes (_e.g._ emission, re-emission, inelastic scattering, fission, decay) occur
